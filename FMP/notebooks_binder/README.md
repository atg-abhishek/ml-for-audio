### Fundamentals of Music Processing 

> Based on the work done by the excellent folks at [FMP](https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/)

There are [binder](https://mybinder.org/) versions for each of the notebooks with my annotations as I go along learning audio processing and applying ML to it.

From a setup perspective, I am using the `conda` environment provided by the creators of these set of notebooks with the following additions:

* I also use [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) which can easily be installed using `pip install jupyterlab` and then run using `jupyter lab` instead of `jupyter notebook`
* I use `conda install --name FMP nb_conda_kernels` to have the specific kernels show up easily in the Jupyter notebooks.
